# Code-optimizer
This is C++ Compiler design Project for code optimizer over 3 address code. Dead code optimization and Copy propagation are implemented.

Input: 1) no. of lines of 3 address code.
       2) 3 address code itself ( user just need to fill lhs and rhs without = sign

Expected 
Output: It will specify the lines which is/are dead( not used in result ).
        And lines with same rhs means copy propagation.
